#####*Note: Chrome for Windows does not display emoji nativelyâ€”If the game is not displaying for you, try another browser.*

emojiSweeper is a clone of the classic minesweeper built in JavaScript and React. 

It uses a nifty cascading peer-to-peer paradigm to propigate instructions, allowing for a non-hirearchical code-structure and cool visual effects.  

The board isn't set until the first click, ensuring that players don't die on the first click.

Controls: click to reveal a tile, right-click to flag a tile as a bomb or unknown.  Flagged tiles can be changed with either right ot left clicks.

###Known Issues:
- [ ] It is possible when starting a new game to create a situation with an unreasonably large number of callbacks.  If this happens, reload the page.  Added disabled state to new game button to make this harder.
- [X] *Fixed* game sometimes reports false-positive victories. Solution: refactor winning function to be more robust. 

### Features to implement:
- [ ] more awesome animated transitions
- [X] remaining bomb count
- [ ] additional modes (candlelight, speed)
- [ ] re-sizable board and difficulty setting
